# Harvard CS50 - Vigenere (Python)
This program uses Python to encrypt messages using Vigenere's cipher, which uses a sequence of keys. It accepts a single command-line argument: a keyword, k, composed entirely of alphabetical characters. Then, it prompts the user for a string of plaintext and prints out the ciphertext.

Assigned as PSET 6 during Harvard's fall 2018 CS50 course.
